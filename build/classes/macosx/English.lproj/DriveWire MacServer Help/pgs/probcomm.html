<h1>Problems with communications</h1>
</div>
<p>Often times, the problem in communication that is encountered between DriveWire MacServer and the CoCo can be narrowed down to either cabling issues or configuration issues.<p>
</p>
<div id="taskbox">
<h2>Cabling Issues:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Insure that the USB to serial convertor cable and the DriveWire cable are properly connected to each other.<li>Verify that the USB to serial convertor is plugged into an available USB port on your Macintosh, and that the DriveWire cable is plugged into the <i>Serial I/O</i> jack located in back of the Color Computer.</ol>
<p>
</div>
			<p>If cabling is correct and proper, there may be configuration issues on the CoCo or the DriveWire MacServer itself.
			<div id="mainbox">
				<div id="taskbox">
					<h2>Other Issues:</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Look at the currently selected serial port on the DriveWire MacServer document window.  If your serial port cannot be selected, you may need to install 3rd party driver software.
						<li>Check that the CoCo button on DriveWire MacServer is set to the proper Color Computer that is connected.

						<li>Are you loading the correct DriveWire client software for your particular Color Computer?
					</ol>
