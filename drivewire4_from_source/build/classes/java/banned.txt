"Oh Birmingham, Thy Nuisance Grows"

Way down in Birmingham, there is a man
With time to waste and some strange plan

We log his coming and we log his leave
We know not what he hopes to achieve

(chorus)
From Mountain Brook City school,
from the neighbor's wireless,
from the iPhone,
and on to networks countless.
Mental case, or some bored kid?
All the same, he's blacklisted.
